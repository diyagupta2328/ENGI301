**SignTalk PCB**
This project is a PCB designed for Project 1 from this class. The updated system block diagram and a mechanical drawing is in a ppt in the project_02 folder. Through this project I was introduced to Eagle for designing and PCB and went through the process of getting a PCB ready for manufacture. 

This repository includes a schematic as a pdf, all the EAGLE files (library, schematic, board), manufacturing files, and implementation files.
